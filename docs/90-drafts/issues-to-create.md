### CI-01 — CI/CD: Main CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)

**Suggested labels:** `CI/CD`, `Setup`

**Description:**

Set up the main CI workflow (`ascension-ci`) that runs on every `push` and `pull_request`. The pipeline orchestrates format, lint, build and test validation for all three monorepo applications (Rust, Flutter, Python).

**Features implemented:**
- Detection of the `[no-ci]` prefix to skip all checks
- Commit message format validation (via `check_commit`)
- Branch name format validation (via `check_branch`)
- `check_server` job: rustfmt, clippy, release build, tests (with Cargo + moon cache)
- `check_mobile` job: flutter format, flutter analyze, flutter test (with pub + moon cache)
- `check_ai` job: black lint, pytest (with conda + moon cache)
- Concurrency: duplicate run cancellation on the same branch

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] The `ascension-ci` workflow triggers on `push` and `pull_request`
- [x] `check_server`, `check_mobile`, `check_ai` jobs run in parallel
- [x] Cargo, pub and conda caches are functional
- [x] The `[no-ci]` prefix skips all checks
- [x] Jobs depend on `detect_no_ci` and `check_commit_and_branch`
- [x] CI is documented in the developer guide

### CI-02 — CI/CD: Commit and branch validation scripts

**Suggested labels:** `CI/CD`, `Setup`

**Description:**

Implementation of two Python scripts (`.github/scripts/check_commit` and `.github/scripts/check_branch`) that validate commit message format and branch name format respectively, according to the project conventions.

**Enforced conventions:**
- Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <description>` with types listed in `.github/keywords.txt`
- Branches: `main`, `dev` or `<type>/<kebab-case-description>`
- Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `tests`, `build`, `perf`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`, `add`, `remove`, `rename`, `move`, `merge`, `init`, `details`, `dependabot`, `agents`, `temp`

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] `check_commit` validates the `<type>(<scope>): <description>` format
- [x] `check_commit` allows `Merge ...` commits without validation
- [x] `check_branch` accepts `main` and `dev` as-is
- [x] `check_branch` validates `<type>/<kebab-case>`
- [x] Errors are formatted as GitHub Actions annotations (`::error::`)
- [x] Scripts are executable and used by the CI
- [x] `.github/keywords.txt` contains all allowed commit types

---

### CI-03 — CI/CD: Deploy workflow (Docker + APK + GitHub Release)

**Suggested labels:** `CI/CD`, `Build`

**Description:**

Set up the `ascension-deploy` workflow that triggers on `v*` tags. It builds and pushes the server Docker image to GHCR, builds the Android APK in release mode, and automatically creates a GitHub Release with the artifacts.

**Jobs:**
- `build_and_push_server`: Multi-stage Docker build of the Rust server → push to GHCR with `:vX.Y.Z` and `:latest` tags
- `build_and_push_mobile`: Flutter release APK build → upload GitHub Actions artifact
- `create_release`: Creates the GitHub Release with auto-generated release notes and the APK as a release asset

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] The workflow triggers on `v*` tags
- [x] The server Docker image is pushed to GHCR with the correct tag
- [x] The Android release APK is built and attached to the GitHub Release
- [x] GitHub Release notes are auto-generated (`generate_release_notes: true`)
- [x] Docker BuildX cache (GHA) is configured to speed up builds
- [ ] The `build_and_push_ai` job is uncommented and functional (currently disabled)

### CI-04 — CI/CD: dev-to-production workflow (promotion + semver tag + mirror)

**Suggested labels:** `CI/CD`, `Setup`

**Description:**

Set up the manual `ascension-dev-to-production` workflow that automates the promotion from `dev` to `main`, the creation of an auto-incremented SemVer tag, and the mirroring of the repo to an external repository.

**Jobs:**
- `merge_branch`: Merges `dev` → `main` via GitHub App token (to bypass branch protections)
- `create_tag`: Computes the next `vX.Y.(Z+1)` tag and pushes it on `main`
- `mirror_repository`: Mirrors the repo to an external SSH repository (Epitech intranet)

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] The `dev → main` merge works with the GitHub App token
- [x] The SemVer tag is auto-computed from the last existing `v*` tag
- [x] SSH mirror to the external repository is functional
- [x] `APP_ID`, `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `MIRROR_SSH_KEY` secrets are configured
- [x] The `MIRROR_REPOSITORY_URL` variable is configured in the repo settings

---

### CI-05 — CI/CD: docs-to-wiki workflow

**Suggested labels:** `CI/CD`, `Documentation`

**Description:**

Set up the `ascension-docs-to-wiki` workflow that automatically synchronizes the content of the `docs/` folder to the GitHub Wiki on every push to `main`.

**How it works:**
- The `generate_wiki` script converts Markdown files from `docs/` into wiki pages with flat naming (`folder-subfolder-file.md`)
- Special files (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.) are mapped to standard wiki pages (`Home`, `HOW-TO-CONTRIBUTE`, etc.)
- Internal links are rewritten to point to wiki pages

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] The workflow triggers on `push` to `main` in `docs/**`
- [x] The `generate_wiki` script correctly generates the wiki from `docs/`
- [x] Special pages (`Home`, `HOW-TO-CONTRIBUTE`) are correctly created
- [x] Internal links are rewritten in generated wiki pages
- [x] The wiki is up to date after each push to main

---

### CI-06 — CI/CD: Squad system (triage, assign, label cleaner, sync labels)

**Suggested labels:** `CI/CD`, `Setup`

**Description:**

Set up the Squad system composed of several GitHub Actions workflows to automate issue triage, member assignment, label cleanup, and label synchronization from the team roster.

**Implemented workflows:**
- `squad-triage`: When the `squad` label is applied, analyzes the issue and automatically assigns it to the right member via keyword matching. Supports `@copilot` (Coding Agent) with a capability profile.
- `squad-issue-assign`: When a `squad:<member>` label is applied, adds the GitHub assignment and posts an acknowledgment comment.
- `squad-label-cleaner`: Enforces mutual exclusivity for the `go:`, `release:`, `type:`, `priority:` namespaces. Auto-applies `release:backlog` on `go:yes`.
- `sync-squad-labels`: Synchronizes GitHub labels from `.squad/team.md` (squad, go, release, type, priority, and signal labels).

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] `squad-triage` correctly assigns issues by domain
- [x] `squad-issue-assign` posts a comment and assigns the right member
- [x] `squad-label-cleaner` removes conflicting labels in managed namespaces
- [x] `sync-squad-labels` creates/updates all labels from the roster
- [x] The `go:needs-research` label is auto-applied at triage
- [x] The `release:backlog` label is auto-applied on `go:yes`
- [x] `@copilot` can be automatically assigned (`COPILOT_ASSIGN_TOKEN` secret configured)

---

### CI-07 — CI/CD: Squad AI PR Review (automatic GPT-4o code review)

**Suggested labels:** `CI/CD`, `AI`

**Description:**

Set up the `squad-ai-pr-review` workflow that triggers an automatic GPT-4o code review (via GitHub Models API) on every PR open or update. Each squad agent reviews the files belonging to their domain.

**How it works:**
- On PR open/update, the workflow analyzes the changed files
- For each impacted domain (AI, Server, Mobile, DevOps, Docs, Tests, DB/Infra), the corresponding agent generates a review via GPT-4o
- The review is posted (or updated) as a dedicated per-agent comment
- Uses only `GITHUB_TOKEN` (Copilot Pro unlocks premium models)

**Domain routing:**
- `apps/ai/**` → Quentin (AI / Python)
- `apps/server/**` → Renaud (Rust / API)
- `apps/mobile/**` → Romaric (Flutter / Mobile)
- `.github/**`, `docker*` → Arthur (DevOps / CI)
- `docs/**` → Darius (Documentation)
- `**/test*/**` → Ridjan (Testing)
- `**/migrations/**` → Alexandra (Database / Infra)

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] The workflow triggers on `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`
- [x] Each impacted domain receives a dedicated AI review
- [x] Review comments are updated (not duplicated on re-runs)
- [x] File-to-agent routing is documented
- [x] Works without additional secrets (GITHUB_TOKEN only)

**Suggested labels:** `CI/CD`

**Description:**

Set up the `squad-pull-request-review` workflow that analyzes the files changed in a PR and automatically applies `squad:<agent>` labels to route the review to the right domain experts.

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] The workflow labels PRs with the corresponding `squad:<agent>` labels
- [x] Stale labels from previous runs are removed
- [x] A routing comment is posted/updated on the PR with the domain summary table
- [x] If more than 2 domains are touched, `squad:eric` (Architecture) is added
- [x] Missing `squad:*` labels are auto-created

---

### MOBILE-02 — MOBILE: Auth login and register pages (scaffold)

**Suggested labels:** `Mobile`

**Description:**

Creation of the authentication page scaffolds (`LoginPage` and `RegisterPage`) in the Flutter application. These pages are placeholders pending the full implementation of the JWT authentication flow.

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] `LoginPage` and `RegisterPage` are created and accessible via navigation
- [ ] The login form is functional (email + password)
- [ ] The register form is functional (username + email + password)
- [ ] Pages call `ApiService` for `POST /auth/login` and `POST /auth/register`
